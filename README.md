### About Me

I have many hobbies and don't have time for any of them. I like games, music, electronics, travelling. I also love textiles and fabrics; I love to sew and embroider whenever I have the chance. Currently, I'm learning ceramics, specifically handbuilding as I don't have access to a potter's wheel. 

My favorite game of all time is Dark Souls. My favorite genre of music is metal, specifically prog metal (i know right 🙄). My favorite bands are System of a Down, Animals as Leaders, and Tool. And yes, I **can** name three songs.

I don't like "AI" and its current day use-cases, however I appreciate the mathematics behind LLMs and find Machine Learning interesting :robot:

In high school I made a game using unity that I was very proud of. I still am so if you want to play it -> https://drtuna.itch.io/vape-nation-g4c
